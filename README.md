Welcome!

In this repo, you'll find an exercise I was asked to make for a job interview. All of the data is being pulled from [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and I built the initial version of this completely from scratch in about five days.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

You will need to run this command after cloning the repo in order to install all of the app's dependencies on your local machine.

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Or for a quick look, simply visit [https://rick-and-morty-api-exercise.netlify.app/](https://rick-and-morty-ab-exercise.netlify.app/)!

Thanks for stopping by!
